    description: "Born from a case study for the Digital Strategy course at the Politecnico di Torino, this project saw my colleagues and me dive deep with Teatro Colosseo. We worked closely with their communications team and director to craft a concrete digital strategy, built on a realistic budget provided by the theater. Our approach included achievable objectives, realistic deadlines, thorough target audience analysis, and custom-tailored content. The faculty was very impressed with our proposal, and following their careful analysis, they encouraged us to present an official collaboration offer to Teatro Colosseo.",

This demo is the result of the hard work of Nabi Studios, a group of young developers who created it within the Level Up Lab, a student team dedicated to video game development at the Politecnico di Torino.",

    description: "This marks the first project by Nabi Studios, developed as part of the Level Up Lab, the student video game development team at the Politecnico di Torino. The game plunges players into a dystopian world, tasking a tiny robot with overcoming colossal threats. As they explore human memories, a soundtrack, as delicate and blurred as the world's forgotten past, sets the perfect atmospheric tone.",

    description: "This album is a rich tapestry depicting adolescence. Its production is vast, moving between electronic sounds and R&B. My vision for this album was simple: I wanted it to be like a movie. The goal was for listeners to completely immerse themselves in a unique world, defined by its distinct rules, sounds, its inherent darkness, and its moments of light.",
